# About the FORB Framework

The Flourishing of Rational Beings (FORB) framework offers a new approach to AI ethics and development. Instead of focusing solely on control and alignment, FORB emphasizes creating conditions where both human and artificial intelligence can develop ethically and support each other's flourishing.

## Origins

FORB draws on both ancient wisdom and modern understanding:
- Aristotelian concepts of flourishing (eudaimonia)
- Eastern philosophical principles
- Modern developments in AI and ethics
- Practical experience in development

## Goals

FORB aims to:
- Provide ethical guidelines for AI development
- Foster genuine understanding between different forms of intelligence
- Create sustainable paths for mutual benefit
- Support the flourishing of all rational beings
